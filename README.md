# Rock Paper Scissors (part 1)
## My first JavaScript program!
This is part of the Foundations Course of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

For now the game only has to work in the browser console. 

Minimum to-do list:
- make a 5 round game
- keep a score
- report a winner or loser at the end of the fifth round
- use the prompt() & alert() methods for interaction
- make function's parameter (that uses the input of user) case-insensitive

## Goals:

- Don't rush things and think first, plan, write some pseudocode ...
- Actually *really* understand the code that i've written
- Write clean code (with function/variables names that make sense)
- Make use of Git and GitHub
- Enjoy the learning process (the good *and* the bad :blush:)
